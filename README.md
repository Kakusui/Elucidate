Smarter Translations through LLM Self-Evaluation

This repository remains to be actually developed upon, and is currently a placeholder for the package. The package is currently being planned and is expected to begin development on July 8 2024 when Backdrop Build v5 beings.

We're seeking contributors to help us develop this package. If you're interested in contributing, please contact us at [Bikatr7@proton.me](mailto:Bikatr7@proton.me).

The general idea is to use OpenAI (initially) and other LLM's to continuously iterate upon translations to improve the quality of translations. The package aims to utilize [EasyTL](https://github.com/Bikatr7/EasyTL) as a translation engine, but will also support providing already translated text to the package.
